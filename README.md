# Homework 1 by React course, GoIT school

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can find live page [here](https://veronikanos.github.io/goit-react-hw-01-components/).

All used data were provided in task thus I put them in data directory inside my project.

For styling component I used CSS in JS - library Emotion. There is simple styling, just for basic visual.
